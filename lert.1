.SH DESCRIPTION
.I lert
shows any messages directed to you by Athena Accounts (e.g.
notification that your account is scheduled for deactivation).  Lert is
run automatically during login to assure that such messages are
displayed for you in a timely manner.  You can also run lert manually
from the Athena prompt to review such messages.  You can acknowledge
any current messages directed to you by running lert with the -n
switch.  While this will stop the current messages from being
displayed when you login, it will not prevent you from receiving new
messages in the future.
The default display method is to display each message using cat.
