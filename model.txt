For Clarification:

1.  lert used in login
    may use zephyr or cat
    should not use -n
    i.e. put the messages up every time it is run.

2.  lert run by hand can use -n
    this will tell the server you want to be removed
    the server will remove you from the db, moving your current record
to a log db

so...


(admin view)
administrator does

lertload b < file_of_names

file_of_names
alpha
beta

and makes file lertb (whatever text you like)

(user view)
alpha logs in, gets shown lertb.

when alpha gets tired of seeing lertb, runs

lert -n

which moves that record to log.

(it also shows him all the messages once more--this helps avoid
problems with not seeing some message due to time)

(added fun)
admin can also use

lertdump

to see who is in the database with what categories

lertstop b

to remove all the b's in the database

lertused name

to remove a user from the database

lertsaid

to see who is in the log database

note:  lert0 will be shown first to people getting other messages.
       recommended usage:
	 "To stop seeing these messages, please type lert -n"

or whatever other usage notes people want to show the users who are
being sent messages... (thanks to Craig for pointing out this
documentation horror!)
