changes as of 1/26/95

1.  Lert now has a configurable subject for the email messages.  just
put what you want in "/afs/.athena/system/config/lert/lertsub" and
either in the nightly release (or a special release) the subject line
will change to the first line in the file.

2.  several code fixes to improve portability, security, etc.  while
largely invisible to users (aside from improved handling of some
cryptic error conditions), these should make it easier to improve lert.

3.  display routine code was almost completely overhauled to avoid
"cut and paste" growth.

4.  the program (files, etc) previously known as mom has been renamed.
lert.  that is the new name.
